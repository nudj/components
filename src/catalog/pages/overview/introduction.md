Lejo is nudjâ€™s living pattern library and style guide. Itâ€™s our repository for design patterns, guidelines and React components. Itâ€™s all the stuff we need to build our applications ðŸš€

The idea behind Lejo is stop the conversations around which button is the right button, and let us concentrate on giving the best possible experience to our users.

Itâ€™s living documentation in the truest sense; Lejo is not only the written documentation, but itâ€™s also a node module of components, variables and patterns ready to develop with.
